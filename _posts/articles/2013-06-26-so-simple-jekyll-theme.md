After having so much fun creating and releasing [my first open source Jekyll theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), I figured I'd go at it again. So here be the fruit of that effort --- I call it [**So Simple Theme**](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme), a responsive Jekyll theme for words and photos. 

## So Simple Theme features:

* Responsive layouts. Looks good on mobile, tablets, and desktop devices.
* Full compatibility with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations. 
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Optional Disqus comments.
* Tags for [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) for a better social sharing experience.
* Search script.
* Support for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting]({{ site.url }}/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
* Grunt tasks for easier site development.

</figure>

## Getting started

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [So Simple Theme repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/)
3. Make it your own and [customize, customize, customize](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/theme-setup/).

**Like this theme?** I just released my third theme for Jekyll, with a sweet animated drop down menu, social sharing plugins, and a Grunt build script for theme development. I'm calling it HPSTR and you can [learn more about it here]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-08-26-hpstr-jekyll-theme %}).
