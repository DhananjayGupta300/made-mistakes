To celebrate two years of [drawing portraits every day]({% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}), I'm launching a fun giveaway leading up to the special day.

On August 31st I'll select **(3) winners** at random to draw digitally[^disclaimer] on my iPad, using portrait reference photographs of their choice. Here's a refresher of the type of drawing I will end up doing if you're new to my work.

[^disclaimer]: Upon the drawing's completion the winners will receive PNG files measuring 2048&times;1536 pixels. This contest is for a digital drawing only, the winners *will not* receive a physical drawing.

<ul class="th-grid-full">
{% for post in site.categories.paperfaces limit:8 %}
    <li>
        <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/{{ post.image.thumb }}" alt=""></a>
    </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

Entering the PaperFaces Giveaway is simple. Just fill out the Rafflecopter form below and follow the directions. You can increase your odds of winner by completing some or all of the entry types[^entry-types]. Have fun and good luck!

[^entry-types]: All entries will be verified for completion prior to randomly selecting winners. Following and then unfollowing will do you no good as those entries won't be counted in the giveaway.
