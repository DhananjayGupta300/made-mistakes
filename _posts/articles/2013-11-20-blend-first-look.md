In case you missed it yesterday, FiftyThree announced their first hardware product --- [Pencil](http://fiftythree.com/pencil). For the last month I've had the privilege of wielding a beta version of this stylus to play around with and test. Instead of attempting a review[^review] of the hardware, I figured I'd show some examples of what I've done using one of it's new features, Blend.

[^review]: Expect a full review just as soon as I purchase a production version of Pencil. I want to be completely fair in my assessment and make sure I account for any design alterations that might have occurred from now to release.

## But Does it Blend?

For me Blend is the most interesting aspect of Pencil. Being trained as a traditional artist, it works exactly how one would expect, you draw with Pencil and smudge with your finger. Sure a ton of other *art* applications have blurring and blending tools, but they all break the creative flow by forcing you to tap a button or select a tool from a palette. FiftyThree has made this action fun and true to life by seamlessly enabling drawing and blending in a natural way.

Like all good things Blend is best used in moderation. I've found that it works great for blurring backgrounds to create a bokeh[^bokeh] effect which in turn makes foreground subjects pop. Starting with a drawing I completed months ago, I was able to give it new life by simply running my finger over the background.

[^bokeh]: In photography, bokeh is the blur, or the aesthetic quality of the blur, in out-of-focus areas of an image.

Portrait work is an area I've really tried to focus on with my Paper creations. In my initial experiments I can see Blend playing a contributing role in my [PaperFaces project]({{ site.url }}/paperfaces/). Until now it has been a challenge achieving realistic and smooth skin tones at the size that I draw --- Blend changes all that.

My favorite use of this new *tool* has been to create dreamy and surreal illustrations. This following piece is still a work in progress but I think it conveys a romantic quality that wouldn't have been possible without Blend.

The next couple of months should be fun. I've learned a lot from the Paper community of creators, and I can't wait to see what inspiring works come when more Pencils are out in the wild!
