As I continue to hack away at the design of Made Mistakes and improve on things, I've tried to release a simplified Jekyll starter after each major revision. Just my way of giving back to the community.

Below are all of the Jekyll starters I've open sourced thus far. Each "theme" contains all the `_layouts`, `_includes`, assets, and sample posts/pages to get you started. For the most part they share a lot of similarities (especially in `_config.yml`), which should make switching and updating easier. Not quite on the level of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) or [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/), but I think they get the job done.

## Skinny Bones (alpha)
