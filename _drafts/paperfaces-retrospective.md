*Drawing a day* projects are a lot like New Year's resolutions -- easy to start, hard to follow through. 

Two years ago I felt inspired to start drawing again as a way to improve skills that had laid dormant for a decade or so. With an iPad in my lap and a stylus in hand I set out to draw as many portraits I could before I bored of the whole thing.

## How Did You Do It?

I'm not going to lie, finding the motivation to create something everyday is incredibly difficult. And even with the proper motivation, making the time for it is even harder. I'm proof that finishing a 365 day project is possible while maintaining a healthy family and work life balance.

Having a routine was the key to this success. After my 50th portrait I settled into a daily routine of drawing for an hour after putting the girls to bed. By setting this time aside each day I mentally set expectations for myself. If I was more loose with this structure I probably would have given up on the project shortly after starting.

Along with this schedule, making my efforts public served as a motivator. As the amount of eyeballs following my progress increased over the months as did the pressure. I suppose this could be seen as a negative but I always thought of it as positive reinforcement --- small nudges anytime I felt lazy.

## Creating Is Addicting

If you've ever gotten a tattoo then you probably know something about addiction --- drawing these portraits felt a little like that. After finishing one drawing I would begin thinking about tomorrow's. Researching techniques and planning ways to make the next one stronger and better than the last.

## Creating Is Rewarding

How cool would it be to see a years worth of drawings assembled together? It's easy to get lost in the daily fragments and it wasn't something clear to me until I printed my first [Moleskine book](#book-review). The idea of someday being able to look back on such a large body of work is very powerful --- at least it was for me.

## Keep It Fun

To avoid constantly comparing my crude work with those in the Paper community creating works of art I set artificial limits.

* Omit anything that is difficult or takes too long (ie: drawing facial features)
* Embrace your mistakes

## Keep It Challenging

Easy and simple can turn boring in a hurry. Part of the excitement of drawing with Paper by 53 was the challenge. When I first started there were only a handful of colors to choose from and no [zoom](#loupe-tutorial) or [Blend](#blend-first-look) features. It was during this time that I grew the most as a creator, learning how to push the tools through experimentation.

As confidence levels grow don't be afraid to change the rules. Over the course of two years I did this numerous times. Whether it was changing the tools I used in Paper from primarily inks to watercolor and pencil. Or when I made the decision move away from the blank faces to more realistic renderings.

## By the Numbers

I had this original idea of just drawing a single portrait each day for a year using my iPad and the Paper app. When I zipped past that milestone I decided another year wouldn't be that big a deal and ultimately completed well over 800 finished drawings.

| Type | No. of Portraits[^portraits]
|---
| Faceless | xxx
| Full Face | xxx
| Black and White | xxx
| Star Wars | xxx
| Animals | xxx

[^portraits]: For the purpose of keeping things consistent I consider a portrait a single drawing regardless if it includes multiple faces. If I was to count the amount of faces I've drawn the numbers would be much, much higher.

## Thank You

The positive support I received in the form of retweets, favs, likes, hearts, reblogs, emails, DMs, and much more --- made the days I thought about giving up tolerable.
