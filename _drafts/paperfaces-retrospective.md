*Drawing a day* projects are a lot like resolutions made in the New Year. Often started with the best of intentions, but abandoned shortly after from lack of motivation.

Two years ago I felt inspired to start the [**PaperFaces Project**]({% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}) as a way to improve drawing skills that had laid dormant for a decade or so. With an iPad, a stylus, and the Paper by FiftyThree app, I set out to draw as many portraits as possible before boring of the idea.

## How Did You Do It?

I'm not going to lie, finding the motivation to create something every day is incredibly difficult. Even with the proper motivation, making yourself available can be even more challenging. I'm proof that it can be done while working a full time job, caring for a set of twins, maintaining healthly eating and sleeping habits, and dealing with spiders and other creepy crawlies for my wife.

### Form a Routine

Having a routine and sticking to it was the key to hitting my goal. After my 50th portrait I settled into a daily routine of putting the twins to bed and then drawing for an hour. Making time became natural because my mind got used to the schedule and started mentally freeing up time. If I was more loose with this structure I probably would have given up a long time ago.

### Share It

Making my project and efforts public was another huge reason I kept at it for so long. With each new follower or portrait request came an increase in pressure to continue on. I suppose this could have affected me in a negative way, but I decided to look at them as positive reinforcements --- small nudges to keep me from slacking.

Don't start a 365 project just for the sake of starting one. Having a clear objective of what you want to get out of it will help focus and motivate you to continue on. I wanted to improve my drawing skills and drawing random people from the internet became a way for me to do that.

## Creating Is Addicting

If you've ever gotten a tattoo then you probably know something about addiction --- drawing a portrait every day and posting it online felt a little like that. Immediately after finishing one drawing I would begin thinking about the next and ways of making it stronger than the last.

## Creating Is Rewarding

On their own some of these drawings may not be terribly interesting or special, but together they can take on *Voltron*-like qualities. Only after building a [PaperFaces web gallery]({{ site.url }}/paperfaces/) and printing my first [Moleskine books]({% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-11-08-moleskine-book %}) did this become clear to me.

## Keep It Fun

The last thing anyone wants to do is make more work for themselves. To avoid turning this into a chore *I had to complete everyday* I set some artificial limits for myself:

* Omit anything that is difficult or takes too long, e.g. drawing facial features
* Choose subject matter that has enough variation to stay fresh for a year or longer, e.g. a new face every day

## Keep It Challenging

Easy and simple can turn boring in a hurry. The challenge associated with Paper by 53 was what attracted me to the app and doing a 365 day project. When I first started there were only a handful of colors to choose from and no [zoom](#loupe-tutorial) or [Blend](#blend-first-look) features. It was during this time that I grew the most as a creator, learning how to push the tools through practice and experimentation.

As confidence levels grow don't be afraid to change the rules and push yourself. Over the course of two years I did this numerous times. Whether it was changing the tools I used in Paper from primarily inks to watercolor and pencil. Or when I made the decision to move away from the blank faces and attempt to draw more realistic renderings.

## By the Numbers

I had this original idea of just drawing a single portrait each day for a year using my iPad and the Paper app. When I zipped past that milestone I decided another year wouldn't be that big a deal and ultimately completed {{ site.categories.paperfaces | size }} finished drawings.

Here's a breakdown of various types of portraits I've completed.

| Type | No. of Portraits[^portraits]
|---
| Faceless | 522
| [Star Wars]({{ site.url }}/tag/star-wars/) | 12
| [Bearded Dudes]({{ site.url }}/tag/beard/) | {{ site.tags.beard | size }}
| Animals and Creatures | 17
| Total | {{ site.categories.paperfaces | size }}

[^portraits]: For the purpose of keeping things consistent I consider a portrait a single drawing regardless if it includes multiple faces. If I was to count the amount of faces I've drawn the numbers would be much, much higher.

## The Strange and the Unique

When my project was picked up by a few high profile designers and developers it spread pretty far through those circles. Drawing as  many bearded dudes in flannel shirts as I have, any time something different came up I was thrilled. Here's a small sampling of my favorite portraits from the last two years that stand out from the rest:

## Thank You

The positive support I've received in the form of retweets, favs, likes, hearts, reblogs, emails, DMs, and much more --- made the days I thought about quitting tolerable. And to the handful of you who supported me in the early days with donations and portrait orders I appreciate your generosity so much!

## What's Next

Don't get me wrong, drawing strangers for the last two years has been great, but a big part of me longs to create work on a personal level again. In a past life I kept [art journals](http://www.blurb.com/b/695432-scripted-entries-from-false-memories?ce=blurb_ew&utm_source=widget) filled with blind contour drawings and scribbled thoughts. I'd love to try and replicate this in Paper, building on the techniques I've mastered drawing portraits and turn them into a set of Moleskine books.

With the free time from not drawing daily portraits, I plan on crafting new tutorials for my [Mastering Paper by 53]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/) series. I know quite a few of you have been patiently waiting, so expect a new batch published more regularly. I also want to get serious about that companion piece I've hinted and turn it into electronic and/or printed books.

And for those who missed out getting a PaperFaces portrait I'm still offering my servcices. Color and black/white Paper portraits can be [commission here]({{ site.url }}/portraits/).
