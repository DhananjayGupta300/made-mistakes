Portraiture is the meat and potatoes of what I use Paper by FiftyThree to create with. You'd think after drawing over 600 faces it would be able to easy for me to share my process and techniques --- you would be wrong. After struggling with writing this guide for the last couple of weeks, I think I shaped into a way that hopefully makes sense.

Like the other parts of my [Mastering Paper by 53 Guide]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/), this one will introduce techniques I utilize and the reasoning behind them. The way I draw and paint has evolved since starting my [PaperFaces Project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}) and I think it makes the most sense to organize it in these same stages.

![Face evolution. Gesture > Blank > Realistic](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

This guide will focus on techniques I use to render smooth and three dimensional faces and less on the specifics of drawing individual features. Anatomy and the mathematical relationships of the face are fairly complicated and you'd be better served [reading a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399507914/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0399507914&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20) on the matter. Plus I'm not terribly great at photo realism and capturing a likeness.

## Color Palettes for Skin

Before getting into the various techniques I'd like to share some of the palettes I use with Paper. With this set of seven custom mixes I can pretty much reproduce any skin tone I want. Each color wheel below is painted with the brush tool to show how they can be layered with glazes, lightened, and darkened. Tapping the circles below will open into larger views allowing you to save[^saving-images] a copy to use as reference.

[^saving-images]: If viewing on a mobile device like an iPad or iPhone, tap and hold on the image to save to your Camera Roll. On desktop browsers, right click and select *Save image as...*

![Image of 7 skin tone colors](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Paper by 53 currently doesn't have a way of exporting or sharing color palettes. To recreate these on your iPad you will need to following these steps:

1. Purchase the Color Mixer tool if you haven't already.
2. Tap the small circle within the Color Mixer and move the 3 sliders to match the color you are looking to copy.
3. Tap the small circle again and drag it into a vacant spot in your palette to the right.
4. Repeat the process for each color you wish to copy and use.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** You can move colors around in the palettes by dragging them around into an order that works for you. For example I group all of my skin tone colors together for easy access.

## Choosing Colors

In my previous guide I went over a few [color theory basics](#color-theory-basics) that can help guide you to make more informed color selections. Building on top of those guidelines here are a few more that relate directly to painting portraits.

When I'm having trouble getting a mix just right I focus more on whether it is warm or cool and adjust accordingly. With regards to the face, it can roughly be divided into three sections. Obviously lighting has an important role in all of this, but for the most part a fair complexion can be divided like so.

### Forehead

Your forehead is free of surface capillaries and muscles leaving it white or a golden yellow. Along the hairline you'll notice a darker tone that I like to use as a way of blending hair follicles into the scape. But I'm getting ahead of myself, more on painting hair in a future guide.

![Forehead glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Mid-face (Cheeks/Ears/Nose)

Traveling down the face just below the eyes and above the mouth is an area filled with capillaries and therefore *blood*. All this blood causes the ears, nose, and cheeks to turn a reddish color. A simple thing like glazing cheeks with warm mixes of orange and red can liven a face up, especially in females.

![Pink cheek glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Chin

The third section of the face with a noticeable color tone is the area below the nose to the chin. In men this section tends to be a blue, green, or even gray in color. Depending on the amount of facial hair present this color will be more pronounced.

![Facial hair glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

If you remember back to my previous guide, green and red are complementary colors. One way of accentuating a color is by surrounding it with it's complement. I use this trick often when painting female faces when I want to call out their lips --- something I usually downplay on males.

![Pink lips green skin](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

## Painting Skin

To some the watercolor brush and how it works can be a complete mystery --- I completely understand that. To master the brush you have to be mindful of a few things:

### Speed Controls Opacity

The brush produces a range of values by varying the speed at which they're painted. If you move your finger (or stylus) slowly across the iPad's screen, the mark will darken --- moving fast, the mark will fade. The key to creating a smooth tone or glaze is by moving slowly across the screen, rubbing light spots until they turn dark, and never lifting the tip off the screen until you've filled a shape.

![Painting a smooth tone video](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Don't worry about overworking an area and making it too dark. If you linger in a spot it will eventually hit the color's darkest point --- just keep rubbing until it does.
{: .notice}

New to Paper or drawing in general? Make your life easier and work larger, filling up the entire page. The smaller the composition the harder all this becomes since the brush has a fixed size. Well that's [not completely true]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), but for those of you who don't use a Pogo Connect it is.

### Whites to Erase

A *cheat* I used in my early Paper portraits was omitting facial features. I'd spend my time adding detail to the background elements instead of a person's face. Since landscapes and buildings are way more forgiving than faces this allowed me to be more gestural without worrying about capturing a likeness.

To paint in this style I've found it best to lightly sketch out the figure and background to guide you. To simplify things I'm going to *pull a face* out of a bland background. I've found it much easier to drop in a background first, drawing and painting over the face as I work it. This helps eliminate any hard edges or gaps in color that may appear around the faces edge.

![Background with sketch of a face](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With your background dropped in, select the pencil tool, a light color, and sketch out the general outline of a face or body. If you read my introduction to [contour line drawing]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2014-01-13-contour-drawing %}), that technique can be very helpful for drawing sensitive lines that help convey more meaning. For example, I use heavier lines in my sketches to indicate shadows or areas I will want to shade or darken with watercolor later.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** When choosing a pencil color pick a flesh tone that is predominant in the face. This will make it easier to hide the lines later when you paint with white.
{: .notice}

With a rough sketch complete, those skin tone palettes from before are put to work. For this example I'm going to choose the light red mix to start with. If you were to paint with this in its current state it wouldn't be effective at *pulling the face* out of the background. What we need to do is mix white into it to make it opaque[^opaque] and act like an eraser.

[^opaque]: Not transparent or translucent; impenetrable to light; not allowing light to pass through.

![Red mix not lightening](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)
![Red mix with more white added to lighten](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Of course you could just use the eraser tool to remove the background, but it will produce a harsher edge --- which I like to avoid. Using the brush tool in this way allows for greater control over the amount of background you remove with each stroke. Instead of taking it away in one swipe, you can gradually pick away at it for smoother transitions.

![Erased face shape](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Building the Face with Glazes

With the face's shape *pulled out from the background*, we can start the process of rebuilding it. Referencing my custom skin tone colors, choose the light red again and apply an even glaze over the entire face. Don't worry if you overlap into the background, we'll fix that later.

![Watercolor face layer 1](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

If you decide to use your own color mix I suggest one that is fairly light --- the less intense the color the better. Take your time and really observe the shapes you are painting. Drawing is as much of seeing as it is putting a mark on the canvas.

Don't be afraid to [Rewind]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#rewind) a stroke and redo it. I've been known to do this 20+ times until I feel a stroke captures the form's essence. I try to convey more with less (if that makes any sort of sense) and one way to do that is by being deliberate with your brush movements. **Remember speed and direction matter.** When adding shadows to the face start your strokes on the outside and work inwards where you can move my stylus faster to produce softer transitions.

![Watercolor face layer 2-3](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With practice you'll become more confident in the shapes you are painting. I would urge you to avoid brushing with small choppy strokes to prevent the skin from looking old and textured --- unless that look is intended.

![Textured skin](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Don't try to paint everything. Focus on a few heavy shadows on the side of the face or eye sockets to give the impression of a face and call it a day.
{: .notice}

### Adding Shadows

When you need to darken an area, a complimentary color works great especially when the lightness is dialed down when glazing. A heavy and more opaque color is harder to control because it will darken previously painted areas way too fast.

A variation of gray can also be very effective for darkening areas. The important consideration here is to match the temperature of the gray to the area being darkened. If it is warm mix skew your gray on the red/orange side, it it's cool move it more towards blue/green.

![Various grays used for glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Cleanup and Refinement

Depending on how accurate of a painter you are, your glazes may have bleed outside of the face and into the background. To clean up these rough edges, use the pencil tool mixed with a color that matches the background closely. Then use it to cover up blotches or stray marks by drawing over them. Variations to the color may be necessary if your background is more complex than a single tone.

![Pencil edge cleanup](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Don't be afraid to use one of the ink pens for cleanup instead. For stylist reasons I prefer the softness of a pencil, but either tool is acceptable.

## Creating Realism with Colored Pencils

After almost two years of drawing and painting mostly blank faces, I had a break through when reversing my process. Instead of painting with watercolor over a light sketch, and then refining with colored pencil --- I flipped them.

Like before we start with a loose sketch of the subject to rough out the composition. The color of the pencil you use doesn't matter too much, just make it something light that easy to cover up with a darker color.

![Loose pencil sketch](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Refining the Contours

Instead of switching to the brush, we're going to stick with the pencil tool and begin refining the drawing. Color is going to play an important role in this step, if you're not comfortable with that yet work in black and white.

Bouncing between the eraser tool and the pencil, remove stray lines from the initial sketch and sharpen up contour lines that lie in shadow or appear heavy. Gradually increase the darkness of your colors as you work and avoid using black. Refer back to the [face color guidelines](#choosing-colors) from earlier to help make smart color choices.

![Sharpening facial features](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Start with the eyes first and focus your efforts on getting their shape and layout true to life. A detailed eye will help draw the viewer in and take emphasis off of the other features giving you some room for error.
{: .notice}

### Shaping Skin with Hatching

Once you've finished darkening and refining all of the contour lines you'll want to begin shaping the skin. The primary way of doing this will be using [hatching techniques](#parallel-hatching) and dry mixing colored pencils directly on canvas.

The idea is to build up tones from light to dark overlapping pencil strokes and varying the distance between them. The closer the lines, the darker they will appear. I like to work from dark to light an utilize a contour hatching technique that follows the shape of the skin's surface. 

![Contour hatching around the eyes](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

I've said this before in my [Back to Basics guide](#), but it's worth repeating. Be mindful of the direction of the strokes you are making when hatching to enhance the form. 

Don't feel the need to *shade* all of the surfaces. Focus your attention on the darkest values and build up those gradations first. Keep in mind that we will be covering these pencil strokes with watercolor so don't go too dark. I suggest making your tones about 50% lighter than what they really are --- you can always darken things up later.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** A Pogo Connect makes shading and using the pencil tool way easier. By varying the amount of pressure applied to the tip, you can make a darker line in a way that mimics a real pencil.
{: .notice}

	<figcaption>Pressing harder on a Pogo Connect&rsquo;s tip will darken the line.</figcaption>
</figure>

To make the face appear more real you'll want to use a wide range of colors and tones. By applying washes of color pencil on top of each other, you can build up the skin in a more believable way. Don't be afraid to mix blues and greens into pale orange and tans.

![Dry mixing colored pencils](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)
 
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Stick with one color and bounce around the face with it. It'll save you from constantly opening and closing the tool tray to select different colors.
{: .notice}

Continue on hatching and coloring your way through the rest of the drawing. At this point you could certainly call this a finished piece, but I'm going to take it a few steps further.

### Building the Face with Glazes, Again

By applying a thin layer or glaze of watercolor on top, this colored pencil drawing will take on new properties. The colors will intensify with each layer of glaze, and pull everything together.

![Glaze layer one](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

A few well placed brush strokes will go a long way making for a realistic appearance when applied properly. The steps for applying these glazes are almost identical to the earlier. The only difference being the omission of *erasing* the face with white --- you probably won't be doing that unless you're adding a highlight or reflection.

When you've finished painting over everything don't be afraid to go back with the pencil tool and do any necessary cleanup. The same steps from before apply: darken edges, add another layer of hatching, add highlights, etc.

## Wrap Up and What's Next
{:.no_toc}

This all makes perfect sense to me, but sometimes it doesn't quite read that way to other. As always if something needs further clarification leave a comment below and I'll do my best to rectify it.

In the next guide I'm going to [reboot a tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-05-10-how-to-draw-hair-paper-53 %}) I wrote a year ago about how to draw realistic looking hair with Paper. For the most part my technique has remained unchanged, but I think can do better job explaining it with more visuals. So be on the lookout for that...
