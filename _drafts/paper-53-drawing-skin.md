Portraiture is the meat and potatoes of what I use Paper by FiftyThree to create with. You'd think after drawing over 600 portraits I would be able to easily share my process and techniques for doing so --- you would be wrong. I've struggled writing this guide for the last couple of weeks, but I think I finally got it all out in a way that hopefully makes sense.

Like the other parts of my [Mastering Paper by 53 Guide]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/), this one will introduce techniques I utilize and the reasoning behind them. The way I draw and paint has gone through various stages over the year and a half I've been working on my [PaperFaces Project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}). For this guide I think it makes the most sense to organize it in stages, starting with pen and ink techniques up pencil and watercolor photo realism.

## Color Palettes for Skin

Before I get into the various techniques I want to share my most used colors for building up skin tones. With this set of seven custom mixes I can pretty much get any skin color I want by painting multiple layers with some slight hue shifts. Below you will find a color wheel of sorts for each showing how they are affected by multiplying coats or adding pure white and black.

Since Paper by 53 currently doesn't have a way of exporting or sharing palettes to save these you will need to:

1. Purchase the Color Mixer tool if you haven't already.
2. Tap the small circle within the Color Mixer and move the 3 sliders to match the color you are looking to copy.
3. Tap the small circle again and drag it into a vacant spot in your palette to the right.
4. Repeat the process for each color you wish to copy and save.

**ProTip:** You can move colors around in the palettes by dragging them around. I like to have a palette with all my base skin tones grouped together.

## Pen and Ink Wash

1. Fine point pen with black for sketching
2. Keep it loose and gestural. Not trying to make it photo realistic.
3. Use brush to add splashes of color and shading for depth.
4. Limit the amount of colors you use. The small palette Paper shipped with forced me to get creative and was one of the biggest learning experiences I had with the app. The same could be said about the tools you use. Try to pick a tool or two and use it exclusively to really "learn it".

## Watercolor

1. Start with the background first covering your working area.
2. If you need to sketch out the figure use the pencil tool with a light color.
3. Using white or a orange/pink variation of it lighten the face using your sketch as a guide.
4. Apply multiple layers to "erase" the background. I like to use the brush instead of the eraser because it produces softer edges.
5. Start building by mixing a light color or using one of my mixes. The lighter the better since you can apply more layers of paint to get a smoother gradation for shading.
6. Take your time and really observe the shapes you are painting. Drawing is as much of seeing as it is putting a mark on the canvas.
7. Don't be afraid to Rewind a stroke and redo it. I've been known to do this 20+ times just to get a stroke right.
8. Speed and direction matter. If you want a smooth edge you have to move fast to fade it out. When adding shadows to a face I tend to start my stroke on the outside and work in where I can move my stylus faster to produce a softer transition.
9. Color theory is way out of the scope of this tutorial, but here are some general guidelines I follow.
  * For shadows dull versions work best.
  * Avoid heavy dark colors since they are harder to control.
  * Be mindful of cool and warm colors and how they effect the skin you've already painted.
  * Cheeks are often brighter and require more saturated mixes of red and orange.
  * Shadows around the eyes and next are usually cooler with blues and violets mixed in. 
  * Keep the lightness cranked up without turning too bright. Allows for greater control and more layers to build up color.
  * When using white to lighten move fast or dab in color to avoid killing your values.
10. To clean up edges use the pencil tool mixed with an appropriate color matching the background. 

## Colored Pencil and Watercolor

1. Draw a light outline with the pencil tool. I like to use dull light red or brown.
2. Add shadows and crisper lines. Dull purple or dark brown/gray work good.
3. I prefer to use a Pogo Connect since it allows for greater control over shading and can build up tones more gradually.
4. Be mindful of the strokes you are making. I like to think of them as string that I'm wrapping around a shape. Helps determine the direction and makes for a more "sensitive" line.
5. Build up skin using multiple colors that have been cross hatched together. Dull red mixed with orange mixed with browns and even blue.
6. After you've produced a pencil sketch start to apply watercolor. If mixed properly the pencil strokes will show through the watercolor and be enhanced.
7. A few well placed brush strokes will go a long way and can look extremely realistic when applied properly.
8. Don't be afraid to go over the watercolor with pencil strokes following the same "string wrapping" guideline from before. Especially useful for adding in highlights on the bridge of the nose, forehead, and cheeks.
