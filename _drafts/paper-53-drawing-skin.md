Portraiture is the meat and potatoes of what I use Paper by FiftyThree to create with. You'd think after drawing over 600 portraits I would be able to easily share my process and techniques for doing so --- you would be wrong. I've struggled writing this guide for the last couple of weeks, but I think I finally got it all out in a way that hopefully makes sense.

Like the other parts of my [Mastering Paper by 53 Guide]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/), this one will introduce techniques I utilize and the reasoning behind them. The way I draw and paint evolved since starting my [PaperFaces Project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}) and I think it makes the most sense to organize it in these same stages.

## Color Palettes for Skin

Before getting into the various techniques I think it would be helpful to share some of my Paper palettes. With this set of seven custom mixes I can pretty much get any skin color I want. Each color wheel below is painted with the brush tool to show how they react when layered, lightened, and darkened. Tapping the circles below will open into larger views allowing you to save[^saving-images] a copy to use as reference.

Since Paper by 53 currently doesn't have a way of exporting or sharing palettes to recreate these you will need to:

1. Purchase the Color Mixer tool if you haven't already.
2. Tap the small circle within the Color Mixer and move the 3 sliders to match the color you are looking to copy.
3. Tap the small circle again and drag it into a vacant spot in your palette to the right.
4. Repeat the process for each color you wish to copy and use.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** You can move colors around in the palettes by dragging them around. I like to have a palette with all my base skin tones grouped together.

## Painting Skin

I completely understand that to some the watercolor brush and how it works is a complete mystery. To master it you have to be mindful of a few things:

### Speed Controls Opacity

The brush can produce a range of values by varying the speed at which they're painted. If you move your finger (or stylus) slowly across the iPad's screen, the mark will darken --- moving fast, the mark will fade. The key to creating smooth continuous tones is moving slowly across the screen, rubbing light spots until they turn dark, and never lifting the tip off the screen until you've filled a shape.

![Painting a smooth tone video](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Don't worry about overworking an area and making it too dark. If you linger in a spot it will eventually hit the color's darkest point --- just keep rubbing until it does.
{: .notice}

New to Paper or drawing in general? Make your life easier and work as large as possible, filling up the entire page. The smaller the composition the harder all this becomes since the brush has a fixed size. Well that's [not completely true]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), but for those of you who don't use a Pogo Connect it is.

### Erasing a Face

A *cheat* I used in my early Paper portraits was omitting facial features. The time saved by leaving a face blank Instead I'd spend my time adding detail to the background since landscapes and buildings are way more forgiving than faces and give you the freedom to be more gestural.

To paint in this style I've found it best to lightly sketch out the figure and background to guide you. To simplify things I'm going to *pull a face* out a basic and bland background. I've found it much easier to drop in a background first, drawing and painting over a face as I work it. This helps eliminate any hard edges or gaps in color that I try to avoid at all costs.

![Background with sketch of a face](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With your background dropped in, select the pencil tool, a light color, and sketch out the general outline of a face or body. If you read my introduction to [contour line drawing]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2014-01-13-contour-drawing %}), that technique can be very helpful for this step leaving sensitive lines that help convey more meaning. For example, I use heavier lines in my sketches to indicate shadows or areas I will want to darken with watercolor later.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** When choosing a pencil color pick a flesh color that is predominant in the face. This will make it easier to hide the lines later when you paint with a variation of white.
{: .notice}

With a rough sketch done, now we put those skin tone palettes from before to work. For this example I'm going to choose the light red mix to start with. If you were to paint with this in it's current state it wouldn't be effective at *pulling the face* out of the background. What we need is a custom mix with white to turn the brush into an eraser.

![Red mix not lightening](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)
![Red mix with more white added to lighten](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Of course you could just use the eraser tool to remove the background, but it will produce a harsher edge --- which I tend to avoid. Using the brush tool in this way allows for greater control over the amount of background you remove with each stroke. Instead of taking it away in one swipe, you can gradually pick away at it for smoother transitions.

![Erased face shape](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With the face's shape *pulled out from the background*, we can start the process of rebuilding it. Referencing my custom skin tone colors, choose the light red again and apply an even layer over the entire face. Don't worry if you bleed some into the background, we'll fix that later.

![Watercolor face layer 1](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

If you decide to use your own color mix go with one that is fairly light --- the less intense the color the better.Take your time and really observe the shapes you are painting. Drawing is as much of seeing as it is putting a mark on the canvas.

Don't be afraid to [Rewind]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#rewind) a stroke and redo it. I've been known to do this 20+ times to get a stroke just right to capture a form's essence. I try to convey more with less (if that makes any sort of sense) and one way to do that is by being extremely sensitive and deliberate with your brush movements. Remember speed and direction matter. When adding shadows to a face I tend to start my stroke on the outside and work in where I can move my stylus faster to produce a softer transition.

![Watercolor face layer 2-3](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With practice you'll become more confident in the lines you are placing. I would urge you to avoid brushing with small choppy strokes unless you are going for skin that is old and textured.

![Textured skin](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Don't try to paint everything. Focus on a few heavy shadows on the side of the face or eye sockets to give the impression of a face.

### Help with Color

Color theory is complicated and way out of the scope of this tutorial. So instead of going down that rabbit hole I'll share with you some general color guidelines and pointers I loosely follow.

#### The Basics

Having a general understanding of how colors are mixed will help you produce desirable tones when using a glazing[^glazing] technique to paint. Knowing how a color will react when overlapped with another color becomes crucial, unless you like your colors turning to mud.

[^glazing]: Glazing is a watercolor technique that uses a thin, transparent pigment applied over dry existing washes. Its purpose is to adjust the color and tone of the underlying wash.

##### Primary and Secondary Colors

Going back to elementary school you probably finger painted with red, blue, and yellow. If you combine any two of these colors you'll produce a secondary color.

![Secondary colors mixed on canvas](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

I wouldn't suggest going as far as mixing colors directly on canvas to produce secondary colors. But being aware of how these colors react with each other will help you make smarter palette selections when painting.

##### Color Temperature

A color's temperature is worth considering as well. When I'm having trouble getting a mix just right I focus more on whether it is warm or cool and adjust accordingly. If you take a closer look at your own face you'll notice all sorts of temperatures depending on how the blood underneath it affect the skin's color.

A simple thing like glazing cheeks with warm mixes of orange and red can liven a face up. 

![Pink cheek glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Or painting with a cool violet or blue underneath the eyes and neck, to imply divisions in space.

![Cool violet for eye shadows glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

The complexion of a light-skinned face can be divided into three zones, that are often hard to distinguish between.

1. Forehead is a light golden color. Freer of muscles and surface capillaries.
2. Forehead to the bottom of the nose is reddish. Cheeks, ears, and noses have more capillaries and therefore *blood*, which causes the red tone.
3. Bottom of the nose to the chin tends to be blueish, greenish, or grayish in color for men. This is due to hair follicles from a beard or stubble. Accentuating this green color can really bring out the red lips.

#### Painting Shadows

When you need to darken an area, a variation of gray matched in temperature works great. Even better is a dull color with the lightness dialed down allowing for greater flexibility when painting or glazing. A heavy and less translucent color is harder to control because they darken previously painted areas way too fast.

![Various grays used for glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Pencil Cleanup 

Depending on how accurate of a painter you are, your glazes may have bleed off of the face and into the background some. To clean up these rough edges, use the pencil tool mixed with a color that matches the background closes. Then draw over any blotches or stray marks to cover them up and blend away into the background.

![Pencil edge cleanup](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Don't be afraid to use one of the ink pens for cleanup instead. For stylist reasons I prefer the softness of a pencil to the sharpness of ink --- either tool is acceptable.

## Colored Pencil and Watercolor

1. Draw a light outline with the pencil tool. I like to use dull light red or brown.
2. Add shadows and crisper lines. Dull purple or dark brown/gray work good.
3. I prefer to use a Pogo Connect since it allows for greater control over shading and can build up tones more gradually.
4. Be mindful of the strokes you are making. I like to think of them as string that I'm wrapping around a shape. Helps determine the direction and makes for a more "sensitive" line.
5. Build up skin using multiple colors that have been cross hatched together. Dull red mixed with orange mixed with browns and even blue.
6. After you've produced a pencil sketch start to apply watercolor. If mixed properly the pencil strokes will show through the watercolor and be enhanced.
7. A few well placed brush strokes will go a long way and can look extremely realistic when applied properly.
8. Don't be afraid to go over the watercolor with pencil strokes following the same "string wrapping" guideline from before. Especially useful for adding in highlights on the bridge of the nose, forehead, and cheeks.
