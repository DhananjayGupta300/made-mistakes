Portraiture is the meat and potatoes of what I use Paper by FiftyThree to create with. You'd think after drawing over 600 portraits I would be able to easily share my process and techniques for doing so --- you would be wrong. I've struggled writing this guide for the last couple of weeks, but I think I finally got it all out in a way that hopefully makes sense.

Like the other parts of my [Mastering Paper by 53 Guide]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/), this one will introduce techniques I utilize and the reasoning behind them. The way I draw and paint has gone through various stages over the year and a half I've been working on my [PaperFaces Project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}). For this guide I think it makes the most sense to organize it in these same stages, starting with gestural techniques and ending with a more photo realistic approach.

## Color Palettes for Skin

Before I get into the various techniques I want to share my most used colors for building up skin tones. With this set of seven custom mixes I can pretty much get any skin color I want by layering them. Each color wheel is painted with the brush tool to show how they react when layered. Tapping the circles below will open into larger views allowing you to save[^saving-images] each.

Since Paper by 53 currently doesn't have a way of exporting or sharing palettes to use these you will need to:

1. Purchase the Color Mixer tool if you haven't already.
2. Tap the small circle within the Color Mixer and move the 3 sliders to match the color you are looking to copy.
3. Tap the small circle again and drag it into a vacant spot in your palette to the right.
4. Repeat the process for each color you wish to copy and save.

**ProTip:** You can move colors around in the palettes by dragging them around. I like to have a palette with all my base skin tones grouped together.

## Brush Techniques

To some the watercolor brush and how it works is a complete mystery. To master it you have to be mindful of two things: **range** and **shape**.

### Watercolor Range

The brush can produce a range of values by varying the speed at which they're painted. If you move your finger (or stylus) slowly across the iPad's screen, the mark will darken --- moving fast, the mark will be lighter. The key to creating smooth continuous tones is moving slowly across the screen, rubbing light spots until they turn dark, and never lifting the tip off the screen until you're done filling in your shape.

**ProTip:** Don't worry about overworking an area and making it too dark. If you linger in a spot it will eventually hit the color's darkest point, just keep rubbing until it does.

New to Paper or drawing in general? Make your life easier and work as large as possible, filling up the entire page. The smaller the composition the harder all this becomes since the brush has a fixed size. Well that's [not completely true]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), but for those of you who don't use a Pogo Connect it is.

A *cheat* I used in my early Paper portraits was omitting facial features. At the time there was no Zoom tool, and I had trouble creating an accurate likeness, especially at the small size I draw at. Instead I'd spend my time adding detail to the background since landscapes and buildings are way more forgiving than eyes and mouths.

To paint in this style I've found it best to lightly sketch out the figure and background. For the purpose of this guide I'm going to start with a solid background to show one way of pulling a face out of it.

![Background with sketch of a face](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With your background dropped in, select the pencil tool and a light color, and sketch out the general shape. Remember the blind contour exercise? Well use it to help sketch out a sensitive line drawing that will help you paint forms.

**ProTip:** When choosing a pencil color pick a flesh color that is predominant in the face. This will make it easier to hide the lines later when you paint the face with a variation of white.

This is where those skin tone palettes from before come in handy. For this example I'm going to choose the light red mix. If you were to paint with this in it's current state not much would happen. What we need is a custom mix with white added in that will turn the brush into an eraser.

![Red mix not lightening](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)
![Red mix with more white added to lighten](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Of course you could just use the eraser to move the background, but it will produce a harsher edge --- which I don't really like. Using a modified brush color to lighten gives you greater control over the amount of background you remove with each stroke. Instead of taking it away in one swipe, you can gradually do it. A feature I'd love for the eraser tool to inherit...

![Erased face shape](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With our face's shape pulled out from the background, we can start to build it. Going back to my custom skin palette of colors, choose the light red again and apply an even base coat over the entire face. Don't worry if you bleed some into the background, we'll fix that later.

If you decide to use your own color mix go with one that is fairly light. The less intense the color

5. Start building by mixing a light color or using one of my mixes. The lighter the better since you can apply more layers of paint to get a smoother gradation for shading.
6. Take your time and really observe the shapes you are painting. Drawing is as much of seeing as it is putting a mark on the canvas.
7. Don't be afraid to Rewind a stroke and redo it. I've been known to do this 20+ times just to get a stroke right.
8. Speed and direction matter. If you want a smooth edge you have to move fast to fade it out. When adding shadows to a face I tend to start my stroke on the outside and work in where I can move my stylus faster to produce a softer transition.
9. Color theory is way out of the scope of this tutorial, but here are some general guidelines I follow.
  * For shadows dull versions work best.
  * Avoid heavy dark colors since they are harder to control.
  * Be mindful of cool and warm colors and how they effect the skin you've already painted.
  * Cheeks are often brighter and require more saturated mixes of red and orange.
  * Shadows around the eyes and next are usually cooler with blues and violets mixed in. 
  * Keep the lightness cranked up without turning too bright. Allows for greater control and more layers to build up color.
  * When using white to lighten move fast or dab in color to avoid killing your values.
10. To clean up edges use the pencil tool mixed with an appropriate color matching the background. 

## Colored Pencil and Watercolor

1. Draw a light outline with the pencil tool. I like to use dull light red or brown.
2. Add shadows and crisper lines. Dull purple or dark brown/gray work good.
3. I prefer to use a Pogo Connect since it allows for greater control over shading and can build up tones more gradually.
4. Be mindful of the strokes you are making. I like to think of them as string that I'm wrapping around a shape. Helps determine the direction and makes for a more "sensitive" line.
5. Build up skin using multiple colors that have been cross hatched together. Dull red mixed with orange mixed with browns and even blue.
6. After you've produced a pencil sketch start to apply watercolor. If mixed properly the pencil strokes will show through the watercolor and be enhanced.
7. A few well placed brush strokes will go a long way and can look extremely realistic when applied properly.
8. Don't be afraid to go over the watercolor with pencil strokes following the same "string wrapping" guideline from before. Especially useful for adding in highlights on the bridge of the nose, forehead, and cheeks.
