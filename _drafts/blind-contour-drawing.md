One of the first things I drew on my iPad with Paper by FiftyThree was a blind contour line drawing. It has always been an interest of mine and Paper's expressive ink tools are a great fit for the technique. Working in a loose and gestural manner is an excellent way to sharpen your observation skills and learn how the [fountain (Draw)]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#fountain-pen) and [ink (Write)]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#ink-pen) pens behave. Not to mention it can be very cathartic compared to the technical and time consuming nature of drawing photo realistic.

The ideal way to practice this technique is by drawing real object or model --- avoiding photographs if you can. To begin, fix your eyes on the subject in front of you. As they track across the subject's shape, draw a continuous line in sync with what you are viewing. Pay attention to how the form's contour and shape relate to each other making sure to keep your stylus or finger firmly placed on the iPad's screen at all times. The line should remain solid and confident, this isn't sketching or shading exercise.

When you observe a shadow or a dark division, move your stylus faster to produce a thicker line. For highlights and lighter areas move slowly to draw a thinner line. If you have access to a [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) stylus it becomes infinitely easier to produce sensitive lines by varying the pressure applied to the tip. In my opinion this is more natural than the way FiftyThree has engineered the tools. In traditional media --- moving fast produces a lighter (thinner) mark, in Paper just the opposite occurs.

Another way to approach drawing this single contour line, is to think of it as a piece of string being wrapped around the object. Visualize it wrapping around the object and move your stylus in the same way on the canvas. Don't worry if your drawings look like a ball of yarn after finishing --- that's part of their charm. By improving the coordination between hand and eye, the accuracy of your lines should as well.

## Variations and Enhancements

There's a world of possibilities to explore with this technique. For example, you can stick with black ink on white paper and add splashes of color with the brush tool for added depth. When applying color to a blind contour drawing start by looking for the shadows in your subject and brush them in. If you work from the outside edge in, it is easier to fade your strokes by sliding off the screen in a quick motion.

Limit the amount of colors you use when starting out. Working in grays is a great way to learn how to build up value with the brush tool. The biggest learning experience I had with Paper was being limited to the 9 colors it originally shipped with.

For a refresher on watercolor brush techniques take a look at my set of [Mastering Paper Guides]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/). *If you can get the hang of making smooth continuous tones with the brush, there isn't much else you can't do with the app.*

Another variation to try is drawing in white ink on top of a black background. To start you would select black from the palette and then drag it into the the canvas to fill it in. The dark background makes it harder to add color if you choose to, since it would need to be lightened first. But you can certainly leave it as is for a scratch board look.

There is no hard fast rule that says the drawing has to be made up of a single line. Breaking it up into multiple lines made up of different colors and values could produce nice results. Just be careful when stopping and starting if you change tools and colors, you don't want to kill the free form nature of the drawing.
