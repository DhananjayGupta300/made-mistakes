Portraiture is the meat and potatoes of what I use Paper by FiftyThree to create with. You'd think after drawing over 600 faces it would be able to easy for me to share my process and techniques --- you would be wrong. After struggling with writing this guide for the last couple of weeks, I think I finally shaped it in a way that makes sense.

Like the other parts of my [Mastering Paper by 53 Guide]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/), this one will describe my techniques and when to use them. My drawing style has evolved from abstract to realistic since starting the [PaperFaces]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-08-31-paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project %}) portrait project almost 2 years ago. It only seems fitting to group this guide into stages that match that evolution.

![Face evolution. Gesture > Blank > Realistic](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

What this guide won't be is a lesson in human anatomy or the mathematical relationships of the face. You'd be better served [reading a book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399507914/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0399507914&linkCode=as2&tag=mademist-20) on the matter since I'm way under qualified to talk about either with any sense of authority.

## Color Palettes for Skin

Before getting into the various techniques I'd like to share some of the palettes I use with Paper. With this set of seven custom mixes I can pretty much reproduce any skin tone I want. Below I've painted each color wheel with the brush tool to show how they appear when layered, darkened, and lightened. Tapping the circles below will open into larger views allowing you to save[^saving-images] a copy to use as reference.

Paper by 53 currently doesn't have a way of exporting or sharing color palettes. To recreate these on your iPad you will need to follow these steps:

1. Buy the Color Mixer tool if you haven't already.
2. Tap the small circle within the Color Mixer and move the 3 sliders to match the color you are looking to copy.
3. Tap the small circle again and drag it into a vacant spot in your palette to the right.
4. Repeat the process for each color you wish to copy and use.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** You can move colors around in the palettes by dragging them around into an order that works for you. For example I group all my skin tone colors together for easy access.

## Choosing Colors

In my previous guide I went over a few [color theory basics]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}/#color-theory-basics) that can help guide you to make more informed color selections. Building on top of those guidelines here are a few more that are specific to painting portraits.

When I'm having trouble getting a mix just right I focus more on whether it is warm or cool and adjust accordingly. With regards to the face, you can roughly divide it into three sections. Lighting has an important role in this, but for the most part you can divide a face with fair complexion like so.

### Forehead

Your forehead is free of surface capillaries and muscles leaving it white or a golden yellow. Along the hairline you'll notice a darker tone that I like to use as a way of blending hair follicles into the scalp. But I'm getting ahead of myself, more on painting hair in a future guide.

![Forehead glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Mid-face (Cheeks/Ears/Nose)

Traveling down the face just below the eyes and above the mouth is an area comprised of capillaries filled with *blood*. All this blood causes the ears, nose, and cheeks to turn a reddish color. A simple thing like glazing cheeks with warm mixes of orange and red can liven a face up, especially in females.

![Pink cheek glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Chin

The third section of the face with a noticeable color tone is the area below the nose to the chin. In men this section tends to be a blue, green, or even gray in color. Depending on the amount of facial hair present this color will be more pronounced.

![Facial hair glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

If you remember back to my previous guide, green and red are complementary colors. One way of accentuating a color is by surrounding it with it's complement. I use this trick often when painting female faces when I want to call out their lips by painting the shadows in glazes of blue or green.

![Pink lips green skin](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

## Painting Skin

To some the watercolor brush and how it works can be a complete mystery --- I completely understand that. To master the brush you have to be mindful of a few things:

### Speed Controls Opacity

The brush produces a range of values by varying the speed at which they're painted. If you move your finger (or stylus) slowly across the iPad's screen, the mark will darken --- moving fast, the mark will fade. 

Speed is the single most important variable to creating a smooth tone or glaze. The second is never lifting the tip off the screen until you've filled a shape.

	<figcaption>Here's how I paint a shape smoothly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** To even out stubborn light spots, keep rubbing until they turn dark. You won't overwork an area as long as don't lift to make another stroke.
{: .notice}

New to Paper or drawing in general? Make your life easier and work larger, filling up the entire page. The smaller the composition the harder all this becomes since the brush has a fixed size. Well that's [not completely true]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), but for those of you who don't use a Pogo Connect it is.

### Whites to Erase

A *cheat* I used in my early Paper portraits was to omit facial features by not drawing them. I'd spend my time adding detail to the background elements instead of a person's face. I found landscapes more forgiving than faces and not worrying about capturing a likeness was a huge relief.

To paint in this style lightly sketch out the figure and any background elements to act as a guide. To simplify things I'm going to *pull a face* out of a bland background. I've found that it is much easier to drop in a background first, not worrying if you draw or paint over the face. This helps reduce hard edges or gaps in color that may appear around the face's edge.

![Background with sketch of a face](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With your background dropped in, select the pencil tool, a light color, and sketch out the general outline of the figure. Drawing [sensitive lines]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2014-01-13-contour-drawing %}) will convey more meaning in your drawing and guide how you paint. For example, I place heavier lines in my sketches to show shadows or areas I will want to darken with watercolor later.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** When choosing a pencil color pick a flesh tone that is predominant in the face. This will make it easier to hide the lines later when you paint with white.
{: .notice}

With a rough sketch complete, it is time to put those skin tone palettes from before to work. For this example I'm going to choose the light red mix to start with. If you were to paint with this in its current state it wouldn't be effective at *pulling the face* out of the background. What we need to do is mix white into it to make it opaque[^opaque] and act like an eraser.

[^opaque]: Not transparent or translucent; impenetrable to light; not allowing light to pass through.

![Red mix not lightening](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)
![Red mix with more white added to lighten](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Of course you could just use the eraser tool to remove the background, but it will produce a harsher edge --- which I like to avoid. Used in this, the brush has greater control over the amount of background it removes.

![Erased face shape](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Building the Face with Glazes

With the face's shape *pulled out from the background*, we can start the process of rebuilding it. Referencing my custom skin tone colors, choose the light red again and apply an even glaze over the entire face. Don't worry if you overlap into the background, we'll fix that later.

![Watercolor face layer 1](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

If you decide to use your own color mix I suggest one that is light --- the less intense the color the better. Take your time to carefully observe the shapes you are painting. Drawing is as much of seeing as it is putting a mark on the canvas.

Don't be afraid to [Rewind]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-07-31-introduction-tool-guide %}#rewind) a stroke and redo it. I've been known to repeat this action over 20 times until I feel a stroke captures the form's essence. Be deliberate with your brush movements and try to convey more with less (if that makes any sort of sense).

![Watercolor face layer 2-3](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

With practice you'll become more confident in the shapes you are painting. I would urge you to avoid brushing with small choppy strokes to keep the skin smooth --- unless you intend for it to look textured.

![Textured skin](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Don't try to paint everything. Focus on a few heavy shadows on the side of the face or eye sockets to give the impression of a face and call it a day.
{: .notice}

### Adding Shadows

A complimentary color works great as a shadow, especially when dialing down the lightness of your glazes. A heavy and more opaque color is harder to control because it will darken painted areas way too fast.

A variation of gray can also be effective for darkening areas. The important consideration here is to match the temperature of the gray to the area you want to darken. Tint your gray with reds and oranges for warmer tones, and blues and greens for cools.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Work your glazes from the outside in, moving faster to produce soft transitions --- **speed and direction matter!**
{:.notice}

![Various grays used for glazing](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Cleanup and Refinement

Depending on how accurate of a painter you are, your glazes may have bleed outside of the face and into the background. To clean up these rough edges, use the pencil tool mixed with a color that matches the background. Then use it to cover up blotches or stray marks by drawing over them. Variations to the color may be necessary if your background is more complex than a single tone.

![Pencil edge cleanup](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

Don't be afraid to use one of the ink pens for cleanup instead. For stylist reasons I prefer the softness of a pencil, but either tool is acceptable.

## Creating Realism with Colored Pencils

After almost two years of drawing and painting hundreds of blank faces, I had a break through when reversing my process let so. Rough sketch > detailed pencil rendering > watercolor glazes > refinement.

Like before we start with a loose sketch of the subject to rough out the composition. The color of the pencil you use doesn't matter too much, just make it something light that easy to cover up with a darker color.

![Loose pencil sketch](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

### Refining the Contours

Instead of switching to the brush, we're going to stick with the pencil tool and begin refining the drawing. Color is going to play an important role in this step, if you're not comfortable with that yet work in black and white.

Bouncing between the eraser and pencil tools, remove stray lines from the initial sketch and sharpen up lines. Build up tones as you work and avoid using black. Refer to the [face color guidelines](#choosing-colors) from earlier to help make smart color choices.

![Sharpening facial features](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Start with the eyes first and focus your efforts on getting their shape and layout true to life. A detailed eye will help draw the viewer in and take emphasis off of the other features giving you some room for error.
{: .notice}

### Shaping Skin with Hatching

Once you've finished darkening and refining contour lines you'll want to begin shaping the skin. The primary way to do this is with [hatching techniques]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}/#parallel-hatching) and dry mixing colored pencils on the canvas.

The idea is to build up tones from light to dark overlapping pencil strokes and varying the distance between them. The closer the lines, the darker they will appear. I like to work from dark to light and use a contour hatching technique that follows the shape of the skin's surface. 

![Contour hatching around the eyes](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

I've said this before in my [Back to Basics guide]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}), but it's worth repeating. Be mindful of the direction of the strokes you are making when hatching to enhance the form. 

Don't feel the need to *shade* all surfaces. Focus your attention on the darkest values and build up those gradations first. Keep in mind that we will be covering these pencil strokes with watercolor so don't go too dark. I suggest making your tones about 50% lighter than how they appear --- you can always darken things up later.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** A Pogo Connect makes shading and using the pencil tool way easier. By varying the amount of pressure applied to the tip, you can make a darker line in a way that mimics a real pencil.
{: .notice}

	<figcaption>Pressing harder on a Pogo Connect&rsquo;s tip will darken the line.</figcaption>
</figure>

To make the face appear more real you'll want to use a wide range of colors and tones. By applying washes of color pencil on top of each other, you can build up the skin in a more believable way. Don't be afraid to mix blues and greens into pale orange and tans.

![Dry mixing colored pencils](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)
 
<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Stick with one color and bounce around the face with it. It'll save you from constantly opening and closing the tool tray to select different colors.
{: .notice}

Continue on hatching and coloring your way through the rest of the drawing. At this point you could call this a finished piece, but I'm going to take it a few steps further.

### Building the Face with Glazes, Again

By applying a thin layer or glaze of watercolor on top, this colored pencil drawing will take on new properties. The colors will intensify with each layer of glaze, and pull everything together.

![Glaze layer one](http://placehold.it/750x450.gif)

A few well placed brush strokes will go a long way in achieving a realistic look. The steps for applying these glazes are almost identical to before. You won't be *erasing the face* here so you can forgo that step unless you're correcting mistakes or adding highlights.

When you've finished painting over everything don't be afraid to go back with the pencil tool and do any necessary cleanup. The same steps from before apply: darken edges, add another layer of hatching, add highlights, etc.

## Wrap Up and What's Next
{:.no_toc}

This all makes perfect sense to me, but sometimes it doesn't quite read that way to other. As always if something needs further clarification leave a comment below and I'll do my best to rectify it.

In the next guide I'm going to [reboot a tutorial]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-05-10-how-to-draw-hair-paper-53 %}) I wrote a year ago about how to draw realistic looking hair with Paper. For the most part my technique has remained unchanged, but I think can do better job explaining it with more visuals. So be on the lookout for that...
