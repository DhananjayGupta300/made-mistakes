About a month ago FiftyThree added a highly requested feature to their award winning app Paper --- the ability to print. Being a graphic designer I was curious to see the quality of a custom printed Moleskine book first hand. I could think of no better way than to order[^book-disclosure] books featuring a sampling of my PaperFaces portraits and share the experience and results with you.

[^book-disclosure]: In the spirit of full disclosure --- I was reimbursed the full cost (plus shipping) of two Books created with Paper in exchange for sharing them through a short video and photographs. I was not compensated in any other way and all opinions bad grammar are my own.

## Journal to Custom Printed Book

Before I get into my impressions of the printed books, I wanted to quickly discuss the book making process. As expected it was minimally utilitarian and fully integrated into the iOS app. The only problem I had was whittling down hundreds of [PaperFaces portraits]({{ site.url }}/paperfaces/) into a collection of 15 favorites to make up my book.

If you haven't watched any of the [Book videos](https://vimeo.com/75045142) or seen this [lovely set of drawings](http://madewithpaper.fiftythree.com/post/64391384887/how-to-make-a-book-earlier-this-month-we) describing how to make a Book in 5 steps, then here's how the process unfolds --- pun intended.

### Select Your Journal

Adapting a few of my [**Mastering Paper**]({{ site.url }}/mastering-paper/) guides into one page cheat sheets and consolidating them down into a journal became the basis of my first Paper book. If you have a keen eye you might just spot a couple of unpublished sketches from upcoming tutorials...

### Choose Fifteen Pages

As noted earlier, I struggled with selecting 15 pages to turn into a book. I suppose when you have over 550 pages of portraits, narrowing them down to 15 is no easy feat. Maybe next time I'll organize them all into 40 volumes and print my own encyclopedia set of PaperFaces to line a bookshelf. But first I'll have to start saving my pennies to cover the $1,600 that would likely cost to produce. ;-)

**Page Count:** It's worth noting that if you select less than 15 pages for your book, you'll receive blanks filling the balance. Something I'd like to eventually see would be the option to create books with a higher page count. Maybe at larger predefined increments to keep the spine size fixed as not to mess with the cover's alignment and wrap. Adding pages ala cart would be swell, but probably a production nightmare...

### Cover Image

I think the best option is to go fully custom with a cover. What I did was create a sketch for each of my books, and then assign them as journal covers. When you choose to *Print a Book* from the share button, Paper pulls in this cover by default. You also have the option of selecting a black leather texture that mimics a classic Moleskine book --- if you ask me that's a waste of an extra page.

Going fully custom affords you the opportunity of selecting a color for the back cover and spine. As far as I can tell you can't use the color mixer here to pick a color, so be sure to save a one in your custom palettes if you don't like the defaults.

### Order the Book

If you don't have an account you'll be prompted to create one and then verify via a link sent to your email. The ordering process is what you'd expect if you've ever shopped online before --- enter your name, shipping and billing addresses, and payment information. 

After ordering a book you can easily check it's status by tapping **Order Status** from within the *Print a Book* option. Doing so opens a tab in Safari displaying your order number, status, and shipping method. I would assume selecting one of the expedited options provides you with a tracking number for the package, but I went with Standard Shipping so I can't verify it.

## The Printed Details

### Color Faithfulness

### Paper Quality

### Accordion Fold

### Cover and Spine

## Justifying the Price

Yes, $40 for a 15 page book[^page-cost] is bit on the expensive side and you can easily print a book from your local drugstore for half that price. But what really sets books printed from Paper apart is that each is handmade. I've yet to find anyone offer a made to order book, with sweet accordion fold, all within a 2 weeks time.

Not to mention the finished books share the same 4:3 proportion as your Paper creations so there won't be any funny bleeds or crops. What you see in Paper is what you get in real life, straight down to the trademark Moleskine elastic band around the cover and rounded page corners.

[^page-cost]: Not including shipping costs a Paper Book ends up costing about $2.67 per page.

![Crazy for the details. Both digital and printed books have the same rounded corners, accordion fold pages, and elastic band around the cover.](http://placehold.it/750x560)

And then there's that name... Moleskine. The fact that these little books come baring that name instantly adds about 100 hipster street cred points to your work.
