Turn your digital journals into real life manifestations.

Easy to use UI that mirrors the simplicity of entire app.

Hardest part for me was selecting 15 drawings from over 500 for a PaperFaces sampler book.

Describe the process

1. Select your journal
2. Choose 15 pages
3. Choose to use a stock cover or pull from journal's cover image and a color for the back cover
4. Create an account directly in app and order
5. In about 2 weeks your hand crafted Book arrives in the mail

Sure the price is expensive, but you can't argue with handmade. And shoot, it's Moleskine which adds street cred.

Accordion fold is pretty sweet --- adds a artisan feel to it that you don't get with some glossy book printed at your local drugstore's photo center.
