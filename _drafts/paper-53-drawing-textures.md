If you've been following along you now know all my Paper techniques[^techniques] and tricks for painting basic landscapes. Trees, grass, skies, clouds, water, and waves --- all the parts for building a solid landscape foundation. This next part of my Mastering Paper guide will cover texture techniques for creating bricks, wood grain, concrete, and rocks.

[^techniques]: I like to draw loose and quick, and avoid anything that takes the fun and energy from the experience. My techniques focus more on getting the best results in the least amount of time, because who really wants to spend more than an hour on a drawing?

## Drawing Bricks

Bricks can be quite the monotonous subject to draw because of their repetitive nature. Getting the perspective right can also be quite challenging if you're trying to capture a brick road or wall that isn't perfectly flat.

I'm not going to get into perspective or how to set a vanishing point because it's beyond scope of this guide. Instead, the approach I like to take is to sketch lightly with the pencil --- creating guidelines. An easy way to do this is follow along where the cement is between the bricks and sketch your lines there. A photo reference is a big help here.

The color of pencil doesn't really matter, just make it something light (a gray perhaps). A [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}/articles/pogo-connect-smart-pen.html) stylus comes in handy allowing you can to produce lighter lines by gently applying pressure as you draw.

**ProTip:** An iPad smart cover placed on the screen can be used as a straight edge for drawing lines if you dont have a ruler handy.

With a few guidelines placed, we'll next use the mixer to create a base color for the bricks. The mixture I decided on was a brown with some red added in. Remember to mix a color about 50--75% lighter than what you'd like to end with. This is because we'll be applying several layers to the bricks for a more rich and heavy result. If you mix it too dark you'll end up with bricks that are almost black and lack dimension.

When blocking out bricks, I prefer using the watercolor brush versus the marker or fountain pen. Simply put, it leaves you with a jagged edge that's closer to real life. Painting small bricks is next to impossible without a stylus like the Pogo Connect. Without it you're limited to one size, which is quite wide for this sort of detail work.

Show spacing pattern to follow

Apply a second layer to each brick. Keep irregular to add texture and a more natural look.

Show different cement approaches (leave blank, cover all with gray)

Add shadows to bricks. Darker mix of the brown/rust color, or a dark gray.

Apply to lower portion of bricks lightly.

Apply more coats to random bricks if you want more variation

Lightly shade bottom right corners of each brick for more dimnesion using a pencil. Add crisp shadow lines and cracks here and there.

Use the same technique but with a light orange/rust for brick highlights

After you're happy with your bricks use a mid gray to add some pencil texture to the cement lines and correct the shape of the bricks.

## Drawing Wood Grain

The color of wood varies so I'm going to focus more on the process and less on the color. The basic idea is to work from dark to light.

Determine what the mid-tone color of the wood is. Using this photo we can determine that it's somewhere around a medium brown. (show reference)

Mix your mid-tone color to match the photo, then reduce it's brightness about 25%, and increase it's saturation a smidge.

Use this as your base color and paint the shape of your wood with watercolor. Keep it even. The idea with this base coat is to set the tone of the wood. We don't want to go too dark or too light because we'll be applying shadows and highlights to create the illusion of wood grain.

Apply a few more coats until it matches the reference photo.

Mix a variation of the base coat color by making it 10% darker. You might have to play with the hue if the color shifts.
Using a pencil sketch in wood grain. If you look back at our photo reference the grains go up and down. That's the direction we'll be drawing. Look for the light areas and loosely sketch in lines to match their direction and quality.

Switch to watercolor and paint in the darker areas. You may have to lighten the color some if it goes black too fast. Ideally you'll build up a few layers to convey more depth and get smoother gradients for a natural look.

Using black add in any cracks in the wood or knots or to define edges.

Finally add a few strokes a pencil mixed with a lighter variation of our base color. These strokes will become highlights and used to add subtle texture to the wood.

Show some variations on wood textures using different colors. 

### Drawing Concrete, Gravel, and Rocks

Mix your base coat color. I like a mid gray, sometimes with a smidge of blue.

Using watercolor paint and even coat. Keep adding layers until you're happy with the color. You want it to make up the mid tone of your gravel, rocks, concrete, whatever so don't go too dark or light because we want an adequate contrast between the shadows and highlights we'll be adding next.

Mix a darker variation of this color, select the pencil, zoom in, and make a speckled texture like so. Keep it loose and move fast. The "fuzzier" the better.

Mix a lighter version of this color and use the same technique to add highlights here and there.

If you're drawing larger rocks instead the speckled texture, use a watercolor brush and speckle in small rock shapes.

For more variation feel free to vary the color of the rocks to be more red or blue as you block them out in watercolor.

Use a pencil to add shadows to the bottom of each rock paying attention to where your light source is. If the light is on the left put the shadow on the bottom and right. If the light is more on the right, put your shadows on the left. A reference photo will help you determine their placement.

To make the rocks more uniform I'll apply a coat or two of a light gray (or color we used for the base).

Feel free to go in and add more texture using the pencil like we did for gravel.

## Variations on a Theme

Using all of these techniques I was able to create a variety of backdrops for the portraits in my [PaperFaces Project]({{ site.url }}/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project.html). Below are a few finished pieces to show what is possible just by varying the color and composition.
