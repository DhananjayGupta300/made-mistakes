If you've struggled painting smooth tones with Paper's watercolor brush, power on your iPad and download the update right now! FiftyThree just pushed out a set of changes that improves the tool in every way.

So what exactly has changed? If you've spent anytime using the brush tool you probably already discovered that each new wash of watercolor multiplies in intensity. This allows you to create some nice effects with carefully selected colors to add depth and dimension to your sketches.

Where this can become a hindrance is if you're trying to paint a large shape and maintain a smooth and continuous tone. If your hand isn't steady and you accidentally lift off the iPad's screen, the next stroke will be a splotch that doesn't match in consistency.

In Paper version x.x.x, the watercolor brush is way more forgiving and lets you lift off the screen without "ruining" the previous painted area. Now if you're quick you can start painting a shape, lift your finger/stylus, and then go back into the shape emulating a "wet on wet" technique. I don't know many times I'd Rewind a poorly painted shape because I wasn't able to get the edges right in one continous stroke.

To better visualize how the new brush works I shot a quick video that you can view below. As far as I can tell there is about a 1 second delay on how long you can lift off the screen before Paper decides to overlay the strokes.

For those of you who have tried out the new watercolor brush, how's it treating you?
