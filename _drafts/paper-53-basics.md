Reading through my earlier guides I came to the realization that I glossed over many basic drawing and painting techniques. So here is my attempt at remedying that.

## Pencil Techniques

I once described Paper's pencil tool as *versatile and perfect in almost any situation*. When used in conjunction with a [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) or FiftyThree's [Pencil stylus]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), those sentiments ring even truer. So what exactly can you do with the tool?

### Painting with Pencil

Learning how to produce a wash with a continuous tone using the pencil tool is a worthwhile endeavor that I encourage you to practice. Once mastered you will have the skill needed to create gradations that can be used to shade and model forms.

A couple of points to keep in mind for creating an even gradation.

1. Work in one direction and don't backtrack.
2. Don't be tempted to overwork and area. Keep moving at an even pace.
3. If you are using a stylus with a sensitive tip (ie: a Pogo Connect), don't vary the amount of pressure you apply --- keep it constant and light.

Once you've gotten the hang of producing a range of smooth values, it can be fun to introduce additional colors to the mix. Colors can also be blended by overlapping pencil strokes visually mixing them. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Avoid overlapping one color with the other too much. Doing so will kill the translucency of the pencil strokes and any mixing that might have occurred.

## Ink Techniques

Out of the two ink tools that Paper comes with, the [pen]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#ink-pen) (or *Write* as FiftyThree calls it) is much easier to produce consistent results. Stroke speed and pressure do little to modify the line quality which allows you to focus more on accuracy and placement. The [fountain pen]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#fountain-pen) on the other hand can make drawing a straight line without fluctuations in weight incredibly challenging.

![Compare straight lines with ink tools](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

By all means use whatever tool you're most comfortable with. If you're new to iPad drawing and just want to practice the techniques I'm going to describe next, do yourself a solid and stick with the ink pen.

There are many techniques for indicating light and shadow when drawing with ink but they all follow the same general principle. Draw marks where there are shadows, and leave the canvas blank where there are highlights.

### Parallel Hatching

As the name implies, the lines you will be making should run parallel to each other. The lines can be vertical, horizontal, or drawn at an angle --- pick one and stick with it throughout the drawing. By drawing lines closer together they will appear to blend together and create the illusion of being darker.

![Parallel hatching examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Another way to modify the overall tone of these lines is to vary their thickness. This can be achieved by using the fountain pen and drawing thicker lines by either pressing hard (if you use a Pogo Connect stylus) or making quick swipes.

### Contour Hatching

If you're feeling confident and have honed your powers of observation by drawing [blind contours]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2014-01-13-contour-drawing %}), you should be all set for contour hatching. Instead of making straight marks like we did with parallel hatching, you will draw lines that follow curved contours of your subject.

![Contour hatching examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Personally I don't often have the patience required to create an accurate drawing using this technique. When done well contour hatching will enhance the form of your subject and make it appear more three dimensional.

### Cross Hatching

Cross hatching is exactly what you'd expect, hatch marks that cross one another. It's an effective way to quickly darken or *shade* a subject. I like to use the parallel hatching technique and build on that by crossing the lines at a slight angle. Contour lines can also be crossed for more life like results.

### Stippling

Instead of using lines to create tone and texture, you can use small marks. Much like the hatching techniques described above you vary the tone by increasing the density of these marks --- the higher the concentration the darker it will appear.

![Stippling examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

The placement of these marks can be as expressive or mathematically as you want. I prefer to be free and loose, but don't let that limit what feels right to you. Stippling marks can be anything you want --- short ticks, dots, crosses, circles. And they can even be combined with hatching to add detail and enhance the effect.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Most of these inking techniques can be adapted to the pencil tool and used to shade and create gradations of tone --- specifically parallel, contour, and cross hatching.

## Watercolor Brush Techniques

### Painting Smooth

### Feathering Strokes

### Lightening with White

Adding white to a color raises it to a tint or a *pastel* color. Tints can be applied in two ways:

1. By adding white, which will often make hues bluer.
2. Apply the color as a thin, transparent layer over white.

### Glazing

Instead of beginning a painting on a white canvas, there are several reasons why artists pre-tone the surface before painting in opaque media. This initial color is called the under-painting.

Warm under-painting is especially helpful for painting of skies or foliage, or any painting with a blue or green tonality. The little bits of color that peek through the strokes will make blues or greens sparkle by complementary contrast.

Paint that is transparent allows light to pass through it, the brush is this way. 

## Color Theory Basics

### Primary Colors

The idea of a primary color is that it should be possible to mix every other color out of the three primaries. Traditionally that has been red, yellow, and blue.

### Complementary Colors and Grays

When complements are mixed together, they result in a neutral gray. Grays can be mixed from tons of color combinations. I've found that instead of mixing grays from white and black, it is more pleasing to mix them from complementary pairs.

![Mixing grays from complements](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Mixing complements also helps to unify your composition's palette. You can also paint compliments on top of each other to produce a gray.

### Atmospheric Perspective

Bold colors found in the foreground gradually transform until they match the sky. As you go back objects generally lose their color saturation, becoming grayer. Warm colors like orange and red will turn duller and cooler for example.

The amount of contrast between values also changes. The illuminated and shadowed sides of an object grow closer to one another and flatten out.

A loss of clarity can also be observed the farther back you travel. Objects will begin to blur and lose detail.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **General Rule of Thumb:** Warm colors advance, and cool colors recede.
