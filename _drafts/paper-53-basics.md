Reading through my earlier guides I came to the realization that I glossed over many basic drawing and painting techniques. So here is my attempt at remedying that.

## Pencil Techniques

I once described Paper's pencil tool as *versatile and perfect in almost any situation*. When used in conjunction with a [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) or FiftyThree's [Pencil stylus]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), those sentiments ring even truer. So what exactly can you do with the tool?

### Painting with Pencil

Learning how to produce a wash with a continuous tone using the pencil tool is a worthwhile endeavor that I encourage you to practice. Once mastered you will have the skill needed to create gradations that can be used to shade and model forms.

A couple of points to keep in mind for creating an even gradation.

1. Work in one direction and don't backtrack.
2. Don't be tempted to overwork and area. Keep moving at an even pace.
3. If you are using a stylus with a sensitive tip (ie: a Pogo Connect), don't vary the amount of pressure you apply --- keep it constant and light.

Once you've gotten the hang of producing a range of smooth values, it can be fun to introduce additional colors to the mix. Colors can also be blended by overlapping pencil strokes visually mixing them. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Avoid overlapping one color with the other too much. Doing so will kill the translucency of the pencil strokes and any mixing that might have occurred.

## Ink Techniques

Out of the two ink tools that Paper comes with, the [pen]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#ink-pen) (or *Write* as FiftyThree calls it) is much easier to produce consistent results. Stroke speed and pressure do little to modify the line quality which allows you to focus more on accuracy and placement. The [fountain pen]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#fountain-pen) on the other hand can make drawing a straight line without fluctuations in weight incredibly challenging.

![Compare straight lines with ink tools](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

By all means use whatever tool you're most comfortable with. If you're new to iPad drawing and just want to practice the techniques I'm going to describe next, do yourself a solid and stick with the ink pen.

There are many techniques for suggesting light and shadow when drawing with ink but they all follow the same general principle. Draw marks where there are shadows, and leave the canvas blank where there are highlights.

### Parallel Hatching

As the name implies, the lines you will be making should run parallel to each other. The lines can be vertical, horizontal, or drawn at an angle --- pick one and stick with it throughout the drawing. By drawing lines closer together they will appear to blend together and create the illusion of being darker.

![Parallel hatching examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Another way to modify the overall tone of these lines is to vary their thickness. This can be achieved by using the fountain pen and drawing thicker lines by either pressing hard (if you use a Pogo Connect stylus) or making quick swipes.

![Parallel hatching thicker line example](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

### Contour Hatching

If you're feeling confident and have honed your powers of observation by drawing [blind contours]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2014-01-13-contour-drawing %}), you should be all set for contour hatching. Instead of making straight marks like we did with parallel hatching, you will draw lines that follow curved contours of your subject.

![Contour hatching examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Personally I don't often have the patience required to create an accurate drawing using this technique. When done well contour hatching will enhance the form of your subject and make it appear more three dimensional.

### Cross Hatching

Cross hatching is exactly what you'd expect, hatch marks that cross one another. It's an effective way to quickly darken or *shade* a subject. I like to use the parallel hatching technique and build on that by crossing the lines at a slight angle. Contour lines can also be crossed for more life like results.

![Cross hatching examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

### Stippling

Instead of using lines to create tone and texture, you can use small marks. Much like the hatching techniques described above you vary the tone by increasing the density of these marks --- the higher the concentration the darker it will appear.

![Stippling examples](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

The placement of these marks can be as expressive or mathematically as you want. I prefer to be free and loose, but don't let that limit what feels right to you. Stippling marks can be anything you want --- short ticks, dots, crosses, circles. And they can even be combined with hatching to add detail and enhance the effect.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Most of these inking techniques can be adapted to the pencil tool and used to shade and create gradations of tone --- specifically parallel, contour, and cross hatching.

### Ink Blobs and Drips

Using both ink pens and the pencil you can simulate ink splatter, blobs, and dribs. The idea here is to recreate those happy accidents in a natural and random way. To start create a grouping of small circles and dots using the fountain pen.

![Ink circles and a few dots](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)
![Adding variation to the circles](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

To make these shapes more irregular, zoom in and distort their shape by adding bumps and points along the edges. You don't have to overdo this step --- small variations here and there will do the trick.

![Making blobs irregular](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Applying a few shadows and highlights with the pencil tool can make these shapes pop off the canvas. Draw a few dark strokes on one side of the blobs or drips, and then using white or another light color draw a highlight on the opposite side. Depending on how thick of a blob you are going for you may need to add a cast shadow using the pencil or watercolor brush filled with a light gray.

## Watercolor Brush Techniques

I'm going to go ahead and assume you've already read my [Paper by 53 Introduction and Tool Guide]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-31-paper-53-introduction %}#watercolor-brush), where I explain how the brush works and some of its nuances. With this understanding the following four techniques should make more sense. 

### Painting Smooth

The question that hits my inbox the most is "how do you paint so smoothly?" Well here's my secret. Paint a **continuous stroke**, **without lifting** your finger or stylus. If you lift and dab an area multiple times it will darken and turn bumpy --- don't do that!

![Choppy painting vs. consistent painting screenshot](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

The other important variable to consider is moving your finger (or stylus) across the screen at a slow pace. If you rub in a circle motion on an area that is light it will eventually hit it's maximum darkness. As long as you **don't lift** as you circle over these lighter spots, everything will even out.

![Animation of painting evenly](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

### Feathering Edges

Reliably producing a painted edge that is soft and blurry becomes important when mixing shapes into each other smoothly. To achieve this effect you need to move gradually increase the speed of your stroke as you approach the edge you want to feather. 

![Feathered edge example](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)
![Animation feathering an edge](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

A wet-on-wet effect can be simulated by feathering brush strokes into each other. Getting the perfect fade can be tricky, so don't be afraid of rewinding and trying again. *I almost never get it right the first time.*

![Feathered colors](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

### Lightening with White

The watercolor brush has the unique ability of lightening previously painted or drawn areas when used with white. This can be an effective way of pulling highlights out of your subject or to erase mistakes. 

![Range of white tints](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Lightening with colors tinted[^tint] with white often yield better results and are easier to control than a solid white.
{: .notice}

[^tint]: Adding white to a color raises it to a tint or a *pastel* color and increases it's saturation some --- adjust accordingly to keep harmony with your color palette.

![Lightening an area with white](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

White paint behaves slightly different from the other colors available in the mixer and default palettes. Much like painting with pure black it fills in quickly. Which means if you use it to paint, you have to move fast or risk completely covering up anything you paint over.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **ProTip:** Quick, short strokes in a dabbing motion work great for lightening an area gradually. 
{: .notice}

### Glazing

When painting with the brush you are essentially spreading layers of transparent paint (or a glaze[^glazing]) on top of each other. These glazes don't actually mix with one another, but because they are translucent colors can appear to combine. They also have the benefit of increasing the depth and luminosity of a color with each successive layer.

[^glazing]: Glazing is a watercolor technique that uses a thin, transparent pigment applied over dry existing washes. Its purpose is to adjust the color and tone of the underlying wash.

![Glazes created with the watercolor brush]({{ site.url }}/images/paper-53-watercolor-layers.jpg)

I like to think of glazes as my *color harmonizers* that tints everything with a similar hue. A great way to tie a piece together if your colors aren't quite working together.

![Glaze harmonizer](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

### Underpainting

If glazes are applied on top of a painting or drawing, under-painting are the layers applied below. It is most often used to pre-tone the canvas by removing white from it. The color(s) you choose can have a profound effect on digital pigments and strokes applied over them.

![Red underpainting with green tree comparison](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

For example, contrasting colors can create some vibrancy in the scene. A lush landscape filled with a cool sky and green trees, under-painted with a reddish glaze will cause the space around the leaves to shine through. Much more than if the canvas was left white.

Or you can tone the canvas with the composition's dominant color. When doing detail work you won't have to worrying about covering up the bits of white canvas that show through. The background will roughly match what you are painting as your main subject, saving you time precious time.

![Blocking out shapes underpainting](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Underpainting can also be used to establish the correct values and confirm the composition of your subject. Think of it as *sketching* with the brush, but instead of making light lines you are blocking out shapes. These shapes correlate to the subject you are capturing in tone and form.

## Color Theory Basics

### Primary Colors

Thinking back to elementary school you probably heard the term **primary color** thrown around. The idea is that it should be possible to mix every other color out of the three primaries. Traditionally that has been red, yellow, and blue.

Now I wouldn't go as far as suggesting you mix primary colors on canvas to produce secondary and tertiary colors, but it's worth understanding how they're made.

![Traditional color wheel](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

### Complementary Colors and Grays

On the traditional color wheel complementary colors are across from each other (red and green, blue and orange, yellow and violet). When complements are mixed together, they result in a neutral gray. 

![Layering complements](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)
![Variations of gray](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

I've found that instead of mixing grays from white and black, it is more pleasing to mix them from pairs of complementary colors. This gives you a limitless amount of grays to pull from for your palettes.

![Mixing grays from complements](http://placehold.it/750x250.gif)

Mixing complements also helps to unify your composition's palette. You can also glaze compliments on top of each other to dull a color --- useful for creating shadows.

### Atmospheric Perspective

Atmospheric perspective is the phenomenon where intense foreground colors gradually change until they match the sky. As you travel back objects generally lose saturation in color, becoming grayer. For example warm colors like red and orange will dull and cool off.

The amount of contrast in the subject also changes. The illuminated and shadowed sides of an object lower in contrast and flatten as you move further into the background. These objects also begin to loss clarity and will blur and become fuzzy --- a perfect subject for the [Blend tool]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-11-20-blend-first-look %}).

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **General Rule of Thumb:** Warm colors advance, and cool colors recede. The reverse is also true but much more rare in nature.
