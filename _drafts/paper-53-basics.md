Reading through my earlier guides I came to the realization that I glossed over many basic drawing and painting techniques. So here is my attempt at remedying that.

## Pencil Techniques

I once described Paper's pencil tool as *versatile and perfect in almost any situation*. When used in conjunction with a [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) or FiftyThree's [Pencil stylus]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}), those sentiments ring even truer. So what exactly can you do with the tool?

### Shading

Learning to produce a smooth and continuous tone with the pencil tool is a worthwhile endeavor that I encourage you to practice. Once mastered you will have the skill needed to create gradations that can be used to shade and model forms.

A couple of points to keep in mind to create an even gradation.

1. Work in one direction and don't backtrack.
2. Keep your lines perpendicular to each other.
3. If you are using a stylus with a sensitive tip (ie: a Pogo Connect), don't vary the amount of pressure you apply --- keep it constant.

Here's a sample of shading patterns to practice replicating.

Once you've gotten the hang of producing a range of smooth values, it can be fun to introduce additional colors to the mix. If you overlap colors they will begin to blend and create new ones. Something I will touch on later.

## Ink Techniques

### Cross Hatching

### Stippling

## Watercolor Brush Techniques

### Painting Smooth

### Feathering Strokes

### Lightening with White

Adding white to a color raises it to a tint or a *pastel* color. Tints can be applied in two ways:

1. By adding white, which will often make hues bluer.
2. Apply the color as a thin, transparent layer over white.

### Glazing

Instead of beginning a painting on a white canvas, there are several reasons why artists pre-tone the surface before painting in opaque media. This iniatial color is called the underpainting.

Warm underpainting is especially helpful for painitng of skies or foliage, or any painting witha  blue or green tonality. The little bits of color that peek through the storkes will make blueds or greens sparkle by complementary contrast.

Paint that is transparent allows light to pass through it, the brush is this way. 

## Color Theory Basics

### Primary Colors

The idea of a primary color is that it should be possible to mix every other color out of the three primaries. Traditionally that has been red, yellow, and blue.

### Complementary Colors and Grays

When complements are mixed together, they result in a neutral gray. Grays can be mixed from tons of color combinations. I've found that instead of mixing grays from white and black, it is more pleasing to mix them from complementary pairs.

Mixing complements also helps to unify your composition's palette. You can also paint compliments on top of each other to produce a gray.

### Atmospheric Perspective

Bold colors found in the foreground gradually transform until they match the sky. As you go back objects generally lose their color saturation, becoming grayer. Warm colors like orange and red will turn duller and cooler for example.

The amount of contrast between values also changes. The illuminated and shadowed sides of an object grow closer to one another and flatten out.

A loss of clarity can also be observed the farther back you travel. Objects will begin to blur and lose detail.
