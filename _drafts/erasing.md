One of those tools that is easily forgotten about is the eraser --- the utensils used to make marks tend to get more attention than those that remove them. At first blush, erasing in an app like [Paper by 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) may appear limiting and simplistic. When paired with [FiftyThree's Pencil stylus]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2013-12-11-pencil-53-review %}) and some creativity do the possibilities really begin to open up.

## Eraser Tool 101

When opening Paper's tool tray you will find that the eraser is the first tool on the left.

Owners of FiftyThree's Pencil have the added benefit of a dedicated eraser on the top of the stylus. Now you can flow between drawing and erasing by simply flipping Pencil around as you would a *real pencil*. Of course you can still select the eraser from the tool try and use Pencil's pointed tip to erase --- but who does that?

Completely opaque. One stroke erases down to the egg shell white colored background.

### How Speed Affects Erasing

All of the tools in Paper react to the speed at which you use them, and the eraser is no different. When dragging your finger or stylus across the iPad slowly, the eraser will be at its thinnest width. As you increase the speed at which you move across the screen the wider the eraser becomes.

### How *Surface Pressure*[^pencil-only] Affects Erasing

In my review of Pencil I dinged the dedicated eraser as a missed opportunity by not adding any new capabilities to the tool. Well when FiftyThree updated Paper to include the new **Surface Pressure**[^pencil-only] feature, Pencil's eraser got a serious upgrade.

Now when you drag Pencil's eraser across the screen it responds to the edges you make contact with. Touch the corner of the eraser to the screen to remove a small portion of your drawing. Or swipe the fat edge across the screen to erase in broad strokes.

Erasing in close quarters is much easier since the Paper 2.0 update.

### How Pressure Sensitivity Affects Erasing

Currently the [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url}}{% post_url /articles/2013-07-08-pogo-connect-smart-pen %}) is the only pressure sensitive stylus Paper supports. When paired to Paper you can vary the size of the eraser by applying more pressure to the tip as you drag it across the screen.

The harder you press the larger the eraser becomes, and vice versa.

### How to Erase Everything Quickly

Sometimes you just want to clear the entire canvas and start over. Of course you could manually swipe over everything with the eraser, delete the page and create a new, or Rewind back to blank canvas. 

But the quickest way is by press and holding on the eraser tool in the tray. After a few seconds you will be prompted to "Erase" everything. Easy peasy.

## Characteristics of Eraser

I like to compare the line qualities of the eraser to the marker (outline) and fountain pen (draw) tools. Unlike the watercolor brush or pencil tools, the eraser has a smooth and clean edge and is very binary. It either completely removes what it touches down to the egg shell colored background, or it doesn't --- there is no gradual removal.

### Harsh Edges are Good For

The harsh edges produced by the eraser are great for bold illustrations, comics/cartoons, wire-framing, diagrams, and lettering. Basically anything you want to retain smooth edges and keep your line work crisp.

### Harsh Edges are Bad For

Call me biased, but I don't think the eraser tool works well when trying to achieve a *softness* in your work. I create a lot of work in the photo-realistic camp and find that a swipe of the eraser can destroy the textured quality of watercolor and pencil strokes. 

If the eraser removed strokes in a more granular way it might be a different story, but for the most part I avoid the tool like the plague. I've found it much easier to paint with variations of white to "erase" strokes gradually. More on that below...

Notice how erasing the fur strokes creates an abrupt and harsh edge?

## How to Reduce Harsh Edges

If you're like me and lust after a tool in Paper that functions like a traditional gum eraser there are a few hacks to achieve similar results.

### Partially Erase a Line

Instead of completely erasing a stroke you can partially remove it. By leaving fragments of the original, you retain the spirit of it's texture and form. There will still be some "crispness" at the erased edges, but they won't be as harsh.

The easiest way to pull this off is by dabbing your finger or stylus repeatedly while using the eraser. This will lift bits and pieces of the original drawing away with each dab.

This is especially effective during the sketching phase of creation. By leaving part of the drawing on the canvas it allows you to use it as a guide as you continually refine the drawing.

### Blend[^pencil-only] to Erase

Can be used to emulate a gum eraser. Softens lines and leaves a ghost image. More natural to flip between sketching, then blending to erase, back to sketching. Has a nice aesthetic I quite like.

### Use White to Erase

Can be used to emulate a gum eraser. Softens lines and leaves a ghost image.

Not perfect by any means. White is always an option depending on what you are trying to erase. Can create more work for yourself by using white to erase and then having to color match the edges for cleanup.
