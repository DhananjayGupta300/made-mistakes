One of those tools that is easily forgotten about is the eraser. Mark making utensils and media tend to get more attention than those that remove them. Erasing in an app like [Paper by 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper) can be seem limiting at first. When paired with a Pencil stylus and some creativity the possibilities really start to open up.

## Eraser Tool 101

The eraser is the first tool in tray.

If you're using Pencil it is conveniently located on the top allowing you to erase naturally without switching tools.

Completely opaque. One stroke erases down to the egg shell white colored background.

### How Speed Effects the Tool

Slow = thin. Fast = thick.

### How Pressure Sensitivity Effects the Tool

### Tap and Hold

## The Eraser Leaves Harsh Edges

### Harsh Edges are Good For

1. Bold illustrations (cartoon/comic style)
2. Wire-framing and diagrams

### Harsh Edges are Bad For

1. Photorealism
2. Fuzzy textures

## How to Reduce Harsh Edges

### Partially Erase a Line

Broken lines soften a line.

### Use White to Erase

Can be used to emulate a gum eraser. Softens lines and leaves a ghost image.

Not perfect by any means. White is always an option depending on what you are trying to erase. Can create more work for yourself by using white to erase and then having to color match the edges for cleanup.

### Blend to Erase

Can be used to emulate a gum eraser. Softens lines and leaves a ghost image. More natural to flip between sketching, then blending to erase, back to sketching. Has a nice aesthetic I quite like.

## Surface Pressure?

Will the Paper iOS 8 update this fall enhance the eraser? Sure looks that way. Thinner lines by using the edge versus the entire width. Was disappointed that Pencil didn't have this at the start and glad to see it coming.

Would love for a soft eraser that gradually erases, similar to how the watercolor brush works.
