Because no one likes to repeat things here's a compilation of answers to questions I'm often asked. For the most part they're related to my experience drawing on an iPad with the app [**Paper by FiftyThree**](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper).

## Why Do You Only Use the Paper App?

It's hard to explain but Paper's tools feel more natural to me than other iOS sketching apps. An app like [**Procreate**](http://procreate.si/) --- while full of impressive features simply doesn't hold the same appeal for me.

I suppose the main reason I enjoy Paper over the rest is the challenge of capturing realism with it. With other apps it's fairly trivial to import a photograph and trace over it and fake your way through it --- Paper not so much. When creating an illustration in Paper you have to approach it like you would with physical tools and media. I like that.

## Do You Use a Stylus to Draw on an iPad?

I draw and paint with several different styli, each with their pros and cons (see below).

## Which Stylus Do You Recommend for Paper?

The first iPad stylus I purchased was a [Just-Mobile AluPen][alupen-stylus] and used it for quite some time before the rubber tip wore out. The AluPen's tip isn't replaceable so I ended up using a [LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen][lunatik-stylus] next.

I like the Touch Pen because it's built to last. The tip isn't a squishy rubber nib like many others and is super durable. I've drawn close to 400 portraits with it and it works just as flawless as the day I got it. I'd still be using it if I hadn't been lured over to the dark-side of Bluetooth styli.

Speaking of Bluetooth styli, I now use a [Pogo Connect][pogo-stylus] about 99% of the time. For the other 1% I use [53's Pencil][pencil-stylus] to activate the Blend feature when I want to create reflections, bokehs, and other blur effects.

| Stylus | My Quick Impressions
|---
| [*Just-Mobile AluPen*][alupen-stylus] | Lasted me a few months before wearing out. Tips aren't replaceable.
| [*LunaTik Alloy Touch Pen*][lunatik-stylus] | My trusted sidekick for a long long time. Tip took some serious abuse.
| [*Ten One Design Pogo Connect*][pogo-stylus] | Most of my drawings are done with a Pogo Connect now. Two broke due to bad hardware design. Wore through about four R2 tips. Connectivity issues are maddening.
| [*Pencil by FiftyThree*][pencil-stylus] | Super reliable when I'm not wearing out tips in a few days. Flirting with it again after recent Paper update that scales tools when zoomed in.
| [*ZEN 3 in 1*][zen-stylus] | Precision disc tip dead on arrival. Rubber nib still going strong.
| [*Universal Touch Screen Pen*][cheap-stylus] | Cheap, small, light, and pretty crappy. Comes in a 3 pack that I have as a backup if I ever lose my other styli.

## Which iPad Do You Have?

I draw on a 3rd Generation iPad with Retina screen. I've been holding off upgrading because the screens on the new iPad Air do not work well with a Pogo Connect stylus. 

The small 16GB of memory my iPad came with is almost full which is probably going to force my hand soon. Now that I'm using Pencil more maybe it won't be such a big deal, especially when Paper receives "Surface Pressure" with iOS 8.

## How Did You Learn to Draw on an iPad?

**Short answer:** Practice --- lots and lots of practice. I learn something new every time I drag my stylus or finger across the iPad's glass screen. If you're looking for a shortcut to this there really isn't one. The best way to improve is by putting the time into learning your craft through experimentation.

**Longer answer:** I dual majored in graphic design and illustration at the [*Rochester Institute of Technology*](http://www.rit.edu/) with a minor in fine art, so I had a lot of exposure to drawing as part of my curriculum. I learned the fundamentals of capturing 3-dimensional forms from hours of drawing live models with charcoal on large pads of newsprint.

After graduating college I got really rusty at drawing because I stopped doing it for about 13 years. To get my skills back in shape I started a [365 project]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2014-08-29-paperfaces-retrospective %}) two years ago after discovering the Paper app.

## How Do You Draw Those Square Frames?

I [use whatever straight edge]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-07-06-grid-method %}) I have laying around: rule, book, piece of cardboard, notepad, etc. I have a few journal pages of "frames" that I duplicate[^duplicate-page] in Paper anytime I want to use them. Saves me the step of having to redraw the same thing.

[^duplicate-page]: To copy a page pinch the screen to zoom out and then press and hold on the <i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i> plus button until a duplicate button appears. The tap that.

## How Do You Paint Gradients So Smooth with the Watercolor Brush?

By painting a bunch of layers of watercolor on top of each other. Speed and pressure play an important role in how clean of a tone you end up with. My [Paper Basics guide]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /mastering-paper/2014-02-09-basics %}) explains all of the nuances of the watercolor brush and several techniques for using it.

## Have You Ever Thought About Creating a *Mastering Paper* Book?

I have. Once I finish the next couple of tutorials I want to look into creating an eBook version or possibly a printed version.

I would love to print Moleskine books of the guides using Paper's Book feature, but I don't think that will be cost effective. At $50+ a pop that doesn't exactly scream *affordable*.

## How to Export High Resolution Paper Drawings to the Camera Roll?

The image size you can export is only as large as your iPad's native resolution. If you care about getting more pixels out of your Paper art then an iPad Air is the way to go.

To get the best quality image out of Paper I export to the iPad's camera roll and then transfer it with either iCloud's Photostream or Dropbox. For an untainted image without the eggshell background tapping the Camera Roll icon brings up an option toggle the background off or on. When toggled off you will end up with a PNG file with a transparent background (if you didn't fill with another color).

## How Do You Make Videos of Your Paper Drawings?

My [latest videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaLqP2ipMLc6UugVLyTwWTiFtmmZzj7ao) were made using [Reflector](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) to record the iPad's screen and then edited in Adobe AfterEffects to speed them up, include music, and add overlays.

As long as you have an iPad 2 or newer you can use Reflector. Basically you turn on AirPlay mirroring on the iPad and it lets you beam it over to a Mac or PC running Reflector.

My earlier time lapse videos were simply screenshots[^screenshot] that I converted into sped up Quicktime movies using iPhoto's slideshow feature. They're not as dramatic looking because you don't see the actual strokes happening, but still neat in a low tech kind of way.

[^screenshot]: Press and hold the iPad's power and home buttons at the same time. You will see a flash and hear the camera's shutter close if done correctly.

I've also experimented with recording the actual drawing process with my iPhone and speeding that up. Removing glare from the iPad's screen was a real challenge for me and I had mixed results with the [final videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqVzqVG0e5g&index=8&list=PLaLqP2ipMLc6UugVLyTwWTiFtmmZzj7ao). For those who have more patience the results can be quite impressive.
