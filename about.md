## And Who Are You Again?

Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another bearded, tattooed, time traveling, designer and illustrator working in Buffalo, New York. I'm into drawing [portraits of strangers]({{ site.url }}/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project.html) on an iPad using [Paper by 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper), movie theater popcorn, [chicken wings done right](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), dust collecting record collections, and over using ellipses and en-dashes.

When I'm not drawing on my iPad, releasing open source [Jekyll themes]({{ site.url }}/tag/jekyll), or [building the next great thing](http://ekowave.com), I work as an in-house web and print designer for a science education company. On any given day I could be designing product catalogs, marketing collateral, landing pages, email promotions and newsletters, or just getting cozy with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And if that wasn't enough --- I'm a husband and father of twin girls or as we like to call them, [our 2 little rosebuds](http://2littlerosebuds.com "2 Little Rosebuds").

## What's a Made Mistakes?

So what does this all have to do with *made mistakes* and why'd you name your website that? It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for a short, memorable sounding domain name.

In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a Macromedia Flash splash (hey remember those?) while I worked on building a design portfolio using Movable Type. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems ([Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) &rarr; [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/) &rarr; [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) &rarr; [Indexhibit](http://www.indexhibit.org/)), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL databases.

I've since decided to go CMS-free and utilize black magick and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [build the site statically]({{ site.url }}{% post_url /articles/2012-03-19-going-static %}) for greater control and improved performance and security. Building all of the layouts, stylesheets, feeds, and assets from scratch has been challenging, but completely worth it.
